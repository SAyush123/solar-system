# 3D Solar System Simulation with Three.js

This project is a fully interactive, mobile-responsive 3D simulation of the solar system built using Three.js. It features realistic planetary motion, dynamic orbital speed control, and optional enhancements like tooltips, pause/resume, and theme toggle.

## Features

* 3D solar system with Sun and 8 planets (Mercury to Neptune)
* Realistic orbit and self-rotation animation
* Speed control sliders for each planet
* Pause/Resume animation
* Dark/Light mode toggle
* Background stars
* Planet info tooltip on hover
* Mobile swipe gesture for opening control panel
* Responsive and optimized for all modern browsers

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-system-threejs.git
cd solar-system-threejs
```

### 2. Open the Project

You can simply open `index.html` in any modern browser like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

Or run a local server (recommended for better performance):

## How It Works

* Planets are modeled as spheres and animated using `requestAnimationFrame` + `THREE.Clock`.
* Each planet has its own orbit group and rotation logic.
* Speed is dynamically adjustable via sliders built with plain JavaScript.
* Tooltip info and interaction via raycasting.
* Swipe gestures for mobile sidebar controls.
